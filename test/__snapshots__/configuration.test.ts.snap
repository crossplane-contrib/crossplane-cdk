It provides platform APIs to provision fully configured EKS clusters,
with secure networking, and stateful cloud services (RDS) designed to
securely connect to the nodes in each EKS cluster -- all composed using
cloud service primitives from the [Crossplane AWS
Provider](https://doc.crds.dev/github.com/crossplane/provider-aws). App
deployments can securely connect to the infrastructure they need using
secrets distributed directly to the app namespace.
